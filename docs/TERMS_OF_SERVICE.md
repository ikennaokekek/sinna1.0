# Terms of Service

Last Updated: January 1, 2025

Welcome to Sinna. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Sinna API and related services (collectively, the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.

## 1) The Service
Sinna provides an API to transform and enrich video content for accessibility (e.g., captions, audio descriptions, color-safe transforms, preset-based video modifications). You control your inputs; we process and provide artifacts and URLs.

## 2) Accounts & API Keys
- You must keep API keys confidential and secure.
- You are responsible for all activity under your API key.
- Notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorized use.

## 3) Subscriptions & Billing
- Plans are billed in advance via Stripe.
- Standard: $2,000/month; Pro: $3,000/month; Enterprise: custom.
- Fees are non‑refundable except where required by law.
- Subscriptions renew automatically unless cancelled before the next billing date.

## 4) Usage Limits
- Each plan includes monthly limits (e.g., jobs, minutes, storage, request rates) documented in our pricing and your agreement.
- We may throttle or reject requests beyond plan limits.
- We provide programmatic usage endpoints to help you monitor consumption.

## 5) Your Content
- You retain ownership of all content you provide.
- You grant us a limited, non‑exclusive license to process your content solely to provide the Service and to store artifacts per plan limits.
- You represent you have all necessary rights to submit content for processing.

## 6) Acceptable Use
You will not:
- Use the Service for unlawful activities or to violate third‑party rights.
- Attempt to reverse engineer, interfere with, or abuse the Service.
- Use the Service to build a directly competing service.
- Exceed or circumvent rate limits, usage caps, or security controls.

## 7) Service Availability
- We strive for high availability (target ≥99% uptime) but do not guarantee uninterrupted service.
- Planned maintenance and unforeseen incidents may affect availability.
- Status and monitoring details may be provided via the status page and documentation.

## 8) Support
Support level is determined by plan tier. We may provide email support, best‑effort responses, and operational guidance.

## 9) Privacy & Security
- We handle personal data according to our Privacy Policy.
- We use TLS for data in transit and signed URLs for artifacts.
- You are responsible for securing your own systems and integrations.

## 10) Third‑Party Services
We may rely on third‑party processors (e.g., Stripe, Cloudflare R2, AssemblyAI, OpenAI, Render, Sentry). Their terms and policies govern their services.

## 11) Suspension & Termination
We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms, fail to pay, or pose a risk to the Service or others. You may cancel anytime; access continues until the end of the paid term.

## 12) Disclaimers
THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT.

## 13) Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SINNA BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM IN ANY MONTH WILL NOT EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY YOU FOR THAT MONTH.

## 14) Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Sinna from any claims, damages, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your content, your use of the Service, or your breach of these Terms.

## 15) Changes
We may modify these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated via email or the dashboard. Continued use constitutes acceptance.

## 16) Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which Sinna operates, without regard to conflict‑of‑laws principles. Venue and jurisdiction will lie in the competent courts of that jurisdiction.
